		<p>
		  <ul>
		    <li>March 19: To join the <b>Zoom Final Exam</b> video conference use the link.
		    <li>March 17: There will be three test Zoom meeting during which you will have an opportunity to familiarize yourself with the exam protocol:<ul><li> Wednesday, March 18, 7-7:30pm link.
			<li> Thursday, March 19, 11-11:30am link.
			  <li> Thursday, March 19, 7-7:30pm link.
			</ul>
		    <li>March 17: The <b>instructions</b> for the final exam pdf. Note that you will have to be <b>signed in</b> (to Zoom) in order to join the meeting. <br> <br>
		    <li>March 13: There will be 4 additional <b>office hours</b> during the final exam week: Tuesday, March 17, 2pm - 4pm and Thursday, March 19, 2pm - 4pm. <br> <br>
		      The form in which these office hours will be held (in person or online) will depend on the number of students willing to attend them. Please fill in this poll link if you are planning to attend the office hours <b>at least 24h before</b> the time of the meeting. I will then inform you about the form of the office yours. <br> <br>
		      The in person office hours will take place in AP&amp;M 6303. The online office hours will be held through Zoom, so make sure that you have Zoom installed and activated on your computers/mobile devices.
		      </li> <br>
		    <li>March 13: Important information concerning the <b>final exam</b> and <b>final grades</b>: <br> <br>
		      <ul>
			<li>
			  There will be two additional options for computing the cumulative average:
			  <ul>
			    <li> (a) 20% Homework, &nbsp;40% Midterm 1, &nbsp;40% Midterm 2</li>
			    <li> (b) 20% Homework, &nbsp;40% Best Midterm Exam,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40% Final Exam</li>
			  </ul>
			  The grading scheme introduced at the beginning of the quarter is available as well
			  			<ul>
    		<li> (c) 20% Homework, &nbsp;20% Midterm 1, &nbsp;20% Midterm 2, &nbsp;40% Final Exam</li>
    		<li> (d) 20% Homework, &nbsp;20% Best Midterm Exam, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60% Final Exam</li>
		<li> (e) 20% Homework, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80% Final Exam</li>
			</ul>
Your cumulative average will be computed as the maximum of the values obtained via formulas (a) - (e).
			</li> <br>
			<li>You are allowed to drop one (the lowest) of your homework grades. Your Homework score is computed as the maximum of (sum of 6 homework grades)/(sum of the max points for the corresponding homeworks) times 20, where the maximum is taken over all subsets of 6 (out of 7) homeworks. Note that Homework 5 contained an extra problem, so you can have up to 25 points out of 20 for HW5. <br> <br>
			  <b>Example</b>. Suppose you have the following grades for the seven homework assignments: 17, 20, 10, 20, 23, 20, 0. The corresponding max points are: 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 30. You decide to drop the last HW grade (0/30). Then your HW score (20% of the final grade) is: (17 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 23 + 20)/(20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20) * 20= 110/120 * 20 = 18.33. 
			</li> <br>
					    <li>Your cumulative average computed using one of the above formulas will be converted to the letter grade following the updated scale: <br> <br>

			 <br>             
             <p>Welcome to Math 180B: a one quarter course introduction to stochastic processes (I).  This course is the prerequisite
               for the subsequent course Math 180C (Introduction to Stochastic Processes (II)) and is recommended for MATH 112B (Introduction to Mathematical Biology (II)).
	       According to the UC San Diego
             <a href="http://ucsd.edu/catalog/courses/MATH.html" target="_blank">Course Catalog</a>, the topics covered are random vectors, multivariate densities, covariance matrix, multivariate normal distribution, random walk, Poisson process and other topics.</p>
             
             <p>Here is a more detailed listing of course topics, in the sequence they will be covered, together with the relevant section(s) of the
             textbook.  While each topic corresponds to approximately one lecture, there will be some give and take here.

             <p><b>Prerequisite:</b>&nbsp; The important prerequisites are calculus up to and including Math 20D, linear algebra (Math 18 or Math 31AH), Math 109 (Mathematical Reasoning) or Math 31CH (Honors vector calculus), and introduction to probability (Math 180A).</p>
             
             <p><b>Lecture:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Attending the lecture is a fundamental part of the course; you are
             responsible for material presented in the lecture <i>whether or not it is discussed in the textbook.</i>
             You should expect questions on the exams that will test your understanding of concepts discussed in the lecture.
             </p>

			<p><b>Homework:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Homework assignments are posted <a href="#homework">below</a>, and will be due at 11:59pm
			on the indicated due date.&nbsp;  You must turn in your homework through Gradescope; if you have produced it on paper,
			you can scan it or simply take clear photos of it to upload.  Your lowest homework score will be dropped.</b>&nbsp;  It is allowed and even
			encouraged to discuss homework problems with your classmates and your instructor and TA, but your final write up of your
			homework solutions must be your own work.  
			</p>
			
			<p><b>Midterm Exams:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The two midterm exams will take place during the lecture time at the dates listed <a href="#meetings">above</a>.
			<ul>
			<li>You may bring <b>one</b> 8.5 by 11 inch sheet of paper with handwritten notes (on both sides) with you to each midterm exam; no other notes (or books)
			will be allowed.</li>
			<li>No calculators, phones, or other electronic devices will be allowed during the midterm exams.</li>
			<li><i><b>There will be no makeup
 			midterm exams.</b></i></li>
			</ul></p>


			<p>
			<b>Final Exam:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The final examination will be held at the date and time stated <a href="#meetings">above</a>.
			<ul>
			<li>It is your responsibility to ensure that you do not have a schedule conflict involving the final examination; you should not enroll in this class
			if you cannot take the final examination at its scheduled time.</li>
			<li>You may bring <b>two</b> 8.5 by 11 inch sheets of paper with handwritten notes (on both sides) with you to the final examination; no other notes (or books)
			will be allowed.</li>
			<li>No calculators, phones, or other electronic devices will be allowed during the final examination.</li>
			<li><i><b>There will be no makeup
			final exam.</b></i></li>
			</ul>
			</p>


<p>
<b>Administrative Links:</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; Here are two links regarding UC San Diego policies on exams:
<ul>
<p>
<li><a href="http://blink.ucsd.edu/instructors/academic-info/exams/responsibilities.html" target="_blank">
Exam Responsibilities</a>&nbsp; An outline of the responsibilities of faculty and students
with regard to final exams</li>

Policies on Examinations</a>&nbsp; The Academic Senate policy regarding final examinations
(These are the rules!)</li>
</p>
</ul>
</p>


<p>
<b>Regrade Policy:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Your exams and homeworks will be graded using <a href="https://gradescope.com/" target="_blank">Gradescope</a>.
 &nbsp;You will be able to request regrades <b><i>directly from your TA</i></b> through Gradescope for a specified window of time.
  &nbsp;Be sure to make your request within the specified window of time; no regrade requests will be accepted after the
   deadline. <b>Note:</b> Your grader will consider your regrade request only if you
			have explained clearly, thoroughly, and politely why you think an error in grading was made.</li>
</li></ul>
</p>


<p><b>Grading:</b> 

			Your cumulative average will be the best of the following three weighted averages:
			<ul>
    		<li>20% Homework, &nbsp;20% Midterm 1, &nbsp;20% Midterm 2, &nbsp;40% Final Exam</li>
    		<li>20% Homework, &nbsp;20% Best Midterm Exam, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60% Final Exam</li>
		<li>20% Homework, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80% Final Exam</li>
			</ul>
			In addition, &nbsp;<b><i>you must pass the final examination in order to pass the course.</i></b>&nbsp;
			Note also: there are no makeup exams, if you miss a midterm exam for any reason then your course grade will be computed
			with the second or third option.  There are no exceptions; this grading scheme is intended to accommodate emergencies
			that require missing a midterm exam.
			</p>



<p>Your course grade will be determined by your cumulative average at the end of the quarter,
and will be based on the following scale:

<center>        
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="tableBody"><b>A+</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>A</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>A-</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>B+</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>B</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>B-</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>C+</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>C</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>C-</b></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tableBody"><b>97</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>93</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>90</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>87</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>83</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>80</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>77</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>73</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>70</b></td>

</tr>
</tbody>       
</table>
</center>

<p>The above scale is guaranteed: for example, if your cumulative average is 80, your final grade will be <i>at least</i> B-. However,
your instructor may adjust the above scale to be more generous.</p>


			

			
			<p><b>Academic Integrity:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;UC San Diego's
			<a href="http://students.ucsd.edu/academics/academic-integrity/index.html" target="_blank">code of academic integrity</a>
			outlines the expected academic honesty of all studentd and faculty, and details the consequences for academic dishonesty.
			The main issues are cheating and plagiarism, of course, for which we have a zero-tolerance policy.  (Penalties for these
			offenses always include assignment of a failing grade in the course, and usually involve an administrative penalty, such
			as suspension or expulsion, as well.)  However, academic integrity also includes things like giving credit where credit
			is due (listing your collaborators on homework assignments, noting books or papers containing information you used in
			solutions, etc.), and treating your peers respectfully in class. In addition, here are a few of our expectations for
			etiquette in and out of class.</p>

			<ul>
			<li><b>Entering/exiting class:</b> Please arrive on time and stay for the entire class/section period. If, despite your best
			efforts, you arrive late, please enter quietly through the rear door and take a seat near where you entered. Similarly, in the
			rare event that you must leave early (e.g. for a medical appointment), please sit close to the rear exit and leave as
			unobtrusively as possible.</li>
			<li><b>Noise and common courtesy:</b> When class/section begins, please stop your conversations. Wait until class/section is
			over before putting your materials away in your backpack, standing up, or talking to friends. Do not disturb others by engaging
			in disruptive behavior. Disruption interferes with the learning environment and impairs the ability of others to focus,
			participate, and engage.</li>
			<li><b>Electronic devices:</b> Please do not use devices (such as cell phones, laptops, tablets, iPods) for non-class-related
			matters while in class/section. No visual or audio recording is allowed in class/section without prior permission of the
			instructor (whether by camera, cell phone, or other means).</li>
			<li><b>E-mail etiquette:</b> You are expected to write as you would in any professional correspondence. E-mail communication
			should be courteous and respectful in manner and tone. Please do not send e-mails that are curt or demanding.</li>
			</ul>

            <p><h4>Accommodations:</h4>

	      Students requesting accommodations for this course due to a disability must provide a current Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter issued by the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD) which is located in University Center 202 behind Center Hall. The AFA letter may be issued by the OSD electronically or in hard-copy; in either case, please make arrangements to discuss your accommodations with me in advance (<b>by the end of Week 2</b>, if possible). We will make every effort to arrange for whatever accommodations are stipulated by the OSD.
