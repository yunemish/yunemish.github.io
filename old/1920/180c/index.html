		<p>
		  <ul>
		    <li>June 5: <b>Instructions for the final</b> (to be updated):
		      <ul>
			<li>Update: <b>Important</b>. Have your <b>student ID</b> with you during the oral part of the exam.</li>
			<li>Update: If you want to change your exam time (to one of other two available options), send an email <b>before Wednesday</b>.</li>
			<li>Update: The solutions to the exam problems that you upload to Gradescope must be <b>handwritten</b>.</li>
			<li><b>Structure of the exam</b>:
			  <ul>
			<li>The problems for the  final exams will be published on the <b>Canvas page</b> of this course and will become available at scheduled times.</li>
			<li>The solutions to the final exam should be written separately and submitted through <b>Gradescope</b> before the submission deadline.</li>
			<li>The written part will be followed by a <b>Zoom</b> conversation with instructors.</li></ul></li>
			<li><b>Written part</b>:
			  <ul>
			    <li>The problems for the  final exams will be published on the <b>Canvas page</b> of this course and will become available at scheduled times.</li>
			    <li>You will have <b>90 minutes</b> from the release of the exam on Canvas to write the exam + <b>10 minutes</b> to submit the problems on Gradescope. <b>Do not</b> submit the quiz on Canvas before you submit your exam on Gradescope (I am not sure if all devices allow accessing the quiz questions after submission, so if you submit the quiz too quickly you might lose access to the problems. Alternatively, take a picture of your exam problems at the beginning of the exam.)</li>
		    	    <li>Each student will get a random selection of problems of equal difficulty and covering similar topics.</li>
			    <li>Students taking exams at different times will have their problems been selected from different subsets of problems; there is no advantage in taking the exam at later time slots.</li>
			    <li>You have to write your solutions on paper/tablet and submit them through <b>Gradescope</b>. Your answers in Canvas <b>will not</b> be graded.</li>
			    <li>This is an open-book exam. You are allowed to use the textbook, lecture notes, your personal notes. You are not allowed to use the outside assistance. Outside assistance includes but is not limited to other people, the internet and unauthorized notes.</li>
			    <li>You are not allowed to use the calculator or analogous software. All intermediate steps of your computations (computing integrals, solving systems of linear equations etc) should be included in you solutions.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li><b>Oral part</b>:
			  <ul>
			    <li>The Zoom meeting will start 60 minutes after the beginning of the exam.</li>
			    <li>You have to join the meeting <b>not later than 110 minutes</b> after the beginning of the exam (<b>not later than 20 minutes</b> after the end of the written part).</li>
			    <li>You will receive the access codes for the Zoom meeting via email one day before the exam.</li>
			    <li>After joining the meeting, you will be placed into the waiting room. You will be then added to the conversation room one by one in the order of the submission of your exams on Gradescope for a discussion with the instructors. It is important that you are ready to start the conversation at any time while in the waiting room.</li>
			    <li>The goal of the oral part is to make sure that the students do not use outside help during the unproctored exams. You will be asked questions about your solutions to the written part of the exam submitted on Gradescope. Most of the conversations will be very short. In case of serious inconsistencies between your written and oral answers some additional questions might be asked. If it will become clear that the written part is written using the outside help, the case will be reported to AI. If you write your exam honestly, the oral part is a simple formality.</li>
			    <li>The oral part will not be graded.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li><b>Time framework</b>: if <b>T</b> is the scheduled starting time of your exam, then
			  <ul><li><b>T</b>: problems become available on Canvas</li>
			    <li><b>T+60 min</b>: Zoom conversation starts</li>
			    <li><b>T+90 min</b>: the end of the written part</li>
			    <li><b>T+100 min</b>: Gradescope submission deadline</li>
			    <li><b>T+110 min</b>: Zoom meeting locks</li>
			    <li><b>T+180 min</b>: the end of the exam</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li><b>Academic integrity pledge</b>:
			  <br><i>"I pledge to be fair to my classmates and instructors by completing all of my academic work with integrity. <br>
			    This means that I will respect the standards set by the instructor and institution, be responsible for the consequences of my choices, honestly represent my knowledge and abilities, and be a community member that others can trust to do the right thing even when no one is watching. I will always put learning before grades, and integrity before performance. I pledge to excel with integrity. <br>
			    In addition to the above, I pledge that I did not receive outside assistance with this exam. Outside assistance includes but is not limited to other people, the internet and unauthorized notes."</i>
			<br> To acknowledge that you agree to this pledge, you must <b>copy the sentence</b>: <br>
			<i>I choose to excel with integrity as a member of the University of California, San Diego.</i> <br>
			and <b>submit it</b> with your exam on Gradescope. Make sure to sign your name below it and date it as well</li>
			<li><b>On the day of final</b>:
			  <ul>
			    <li><b>(0)</b>: Prepare the notes that you plan to use during the exam. Write, date and sign the academic integrity pledge (see above).</li>
			    <li><b>(1)</b>: Go to the Canvas page of the course, get the exam problems. Start writing the exam.</li>
			    <li><b>(2)</b>: Submit the exam (with the AI pledge) on Gradescope. Join the Zoom meeting.</li>

             <p>Welcome to Math 180C: a one quarter course introduction to stochastic processes (II).
	       According to the UC San Diego
             <a href="http://ucsd.edu/catalog/courses/MATH.html" target="_blank">Course Catalog</a>, the topics covered are Markov chains in discrete and continuous time, random walk, recurrent events and other topics.</p>
             
             <p>Here is a more detailed listing of course topics, in the sequence they will be covered, together with the relevant section(s) of the
             textbook.  While each topic corresponds to approximately one lecture, there will be some give and take here.

             <p><b>Prerequisite:</b>&nbsp; MATH 180B or concent of instructor.</p>
             
             <p><b>Lecture:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;You are responsible for material presented in the lecture <i>whether or not it is discussed in the textbook.</i>
             You should expect questions on the exams that will test your understanding of concepts discussed in the lecture.
             </p>

			<p><b>Homework:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Homework assignments are posted <a href="#homework">below</a>, and will be due at 11:59pm
			on the indicated due date.&nbsp;  You must turn in your homework through Gradescope; if you have produced it on paper,
			you can scan it or simply take clear photos of it to upload.  Your lowest homework score will be dropped.</b>&nbsp;  It is allowed and even
			encouraged to discuss homework problems with your classmates and your instructor and TA, but your final write up of your
			homework solutions must be your own work.  
			</p>
			
			<p><b>Midterm Exams:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The two midterm exams will take place during the lecture time at the dates listed <a href="#meetings">above</a>.
			<ul>
			<li>You may bring <b>one</b> 8.5 by 11 inch sheet of paper with handwritten notes (on both sides) with you to each midterm exam; no other notes (or books)
			will be allowed.</li>
			<li>No calculators, phones, or other electronic devices will be allowed during the midterm exams.</li>
			<li><i><b>There will be no makeup
 			midterm exams.</b></i></li>
			</ul></p>


			<p>
			<b>Final Exam:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The final examination will be held at the date and time stated <a href="#meetings">above</a>.
			<ul>
			<li>It is your responsibility to ensure that you do not have a schedule conflict involving the final examination; you should not enroll in this class
			if you cannot take the final examination at its scheduled time.</li>
			<li>You may bring <b>two</b> 8.5 by 11 inch sheets of paper with handwritten notes (on both sides) with you to the final examination; no other notes (or books)
			will be allowed.</li>
			<li>No calculators, phones, or other electronic devices will be allowed during the final examination.</li>
			<li><i><b>There will be no makeup
			final exam.</b></i></li>
			</ul>

<p>
<b>Administrative Links:</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; Here are two links regarding UC San Diego policies on exams:
<ul>
<p>
<li><a href="http://blink.ucsd.edu/instructors/academic-info/exams/responsibilities.html" target="_blank">
Exam Responsibilities</a>&nbsp; An outline of the responsibilities of faculty and students
with regard to final exams</li>
</p>
<p>
<li><a href="https://senate.ucsd.edu/operating-procedures/educational-policies/courses/epc-policies-on-courses/policy-exams-including-midterms-final-exams-and-religious-accommodations-for-exams/" target="_blank">
Policies on Examinations</a>&nbsp; The Academic Senate policy regarding final examinations
(These are the rules!)</li>
</p>
</ul>
</p>


<p>
<b>Regrade Policy:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Your exams and homeworks will be graded using <a href="https://gradescope.com/" target="_blank">Gradescope</a>.
 &nbsp;You will be able to request regrades <b><i>directly from your TA</i></b> through Gradescope for a specified window of time.
  &nbsp;Be sure to make your request within the specified window of time; no regrade requests will be accepted after the
   deadline. <b>Note:</b> Your grader will consider your regrade request only if you
			have explained clearly, thoroughly, and politely why you think an error in grading was made.</li>
</li></ul>
</p>


<p><b>Grading:</b> 

			Your cumulative average will be the best of the following three weighted averages:
			<ul>
    		<li>15% Homework, &nbsp;25% Midterm 1, &nbsp;25% Midterm 2, &nbsp;35% Final Exam</li>
    		<li>15% Homework, &nbsp;25% Best Midterm Exam, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60% Final Exam</li>
		<li><b>15% Homework, &nbsp;35% Final Exam, &nbsp;50% Bonus</li></b></li>
<!--		<li>20% Homework, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80% Final Exam</li> -->
			</ul>
<!--			In addition, &nbsp;<b><i>you must pass the final examination in order to pass the course.</i></b>&nbsp; -->
			Note also: there are no makeup exams, if you miss a midterm exam for any reason then your course grade will be computed
			with the second or third option.  There are no exceptions; this grading scheme is intended to accommodate emergencies
			that require missing a midterm exam.
			</p>


<p>Your course grade will be determined by your cumulative average at the end of the quarter,
and will be based on the following scale:

<center>        
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="tableBody"><b>A+</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>A</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>A-</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>B+</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>B</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>B-</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>C+</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>C</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>C-</b></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tableBody"><b>97</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>93</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>90</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>87</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>83</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>80</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>77</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>73</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>70</b></td>

</tr>
</tbody>       
</table>
</center>

<p>The above scale is guaranteed: for example, if your cumulative average is 80, your final grade will be <i>at least</i> B-. However,
your instructor may adjust the above scale to be more generous.</p>

			

			
			<p><b>Academic Integrity:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;UC San Diego's
			<a href="http://students.ucsd.edu/academics/academic-integrity/index.html" target="_blank">code of academic integrity</a>
			outlines the expected academic honesty of all studentd and faculty, and details the consequences for academic dishonesty.
			The main issues are cheating and plagiarism, of course, for which we have a zero-tolerance policy.  (Penalties for these
			offenses always include assignment of a failing grade in the course, and usually involve an administrative penalty, such
			as suspension or expulsion, as well.)  However, academic integrity also includes things like giving credit where credit
			is due (listing your collaborators on homework assignments, noting books or papers containing information you used in
			solutions, etc.), and treating your peers respectfully in class. In addition, here are a few of our expectations for
			etiquette in and out of class.</p>

			<ul>
			<!--<li><b>Entering/exiting class:</b> Please arrive on time and stay for the entire class/section period. If, despite your best
			efforts, you arrive late, please enter quietly through the rear door and take a seat near where you entered. Similarly, in the
			rare event that you must leave early (e.g. for a medical appointment), please sit close to the rear exit and leave as
			unobtrusively as possible.</li> -->
			<li><b>Noise and common courtesy:</b> When class/section begins, please stop your conversations. Wait until class/section is
			over before putting your materials away in your backpack, standing up, or talking to friends. Do not disturb others by engaging
			in disruptive behavior. Disruption interferes with the learning environment and impairs the ability of others to focus,
			participate, and engage.</li>
			<li><b>Electronic devices:</b> Please do not use devices (such as cell phones, laptops, tablets, iPods) for non-class-related
			matters while in class/section. No visual or audio recording is allowed in class/section without prior permission of the
			instructor (whether by camera, cell phone, or other means).</li>
			<li><b>E-mail etiquette:</b> You are expected to write as you would in any professional correspondence. E-mail communication
			should be courteous and respectful in manner and tone. Please do not send e-mails that are curt or demanding.</li>
			</ul>

            <p><h4>Accommodations:</h4>

	      Students requesting accommodations for this course due to a disability must provide a current Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter issued by the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD) which is located in University Center 202 behind Center Hall. The AFA letter may be issued by the OSD electronically or in hard-copy; in either case, please make arrangements to discuss your accommodations with me in advance (<b>by the end of Week 2</b>, if possible). We will make every effort to arrange for whatever accommodations are stipulated by the OSD.
