<h2>Instructions for Math 180A Midterm Exam 1</h2>

<ul>
<li>the first midterm exam will take place on Wednesday, October 28 (PST)</li>
 <li>the exam will be available for 24 hours on Gradescope starting on October 28 at 12am/midnight (PST)</li>
 <li>you will have 65 minutes to finish AND SUBMIT your exam; the exam is intended to take 50 minutes: the remaining 15 minutes are intended for the scanning and submission of the exam on Gradescope</li>
 <li>in particular, I will not accept submissions after the 65 minute deadline: it is your responsibility to submit the exam on time (for example, if you choose to write the exam for 65 minutes and do not leave yourself enough time to scan the exam, then you will not receive credit for the exam)</li>
 <li>as with the quizzes, the 24 hour deadline supersedes your allotted 65 minutes for the exam (for example, if you start the exam at 11:40pm (PST), you will need to submit it within 20 minutes to receive credit since the 24 hour deadline would come before the end of your 65 minutes</li>
 <li>there will be no makeup midterm exams</li>
 <li>midterm exams are open textbook, and you can rewatch lectures and review the lecture slides</li>
 <li>keep in mind that any computations on exams must be supported by clear explanations; simply writing down an answer without any justification or work will receive 0 points, even if the answer is correct (unless the problem specifically says that no justification is required)</li>
 <li>you are not allowed to use calculators, computer algebra systems, or similar software; of course, this also means that you will not be asked to solve problems on exams that require the aid of an electronic computing device; you are not allowed to consult other people or resources on the internet; in particular, contract cheating and other instances of academic dishonesty can result in suspension or dismissal</li>
  </ul>
