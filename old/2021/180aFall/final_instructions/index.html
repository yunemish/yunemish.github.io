<h2>Instructions for Math 180A Final Exam</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Important</b>. Have your <b>student ID</b> with you during the oral part of the exam.</li>
  <li>If you want to change your exam time (to the other available time slot), send an email <b>before Wednesday</b>.</li>
  <li>The solutions to the exam problems that you upload to Gradescope must be <b>handwritten</b>.</li>
  </ul>


			
			<li><b>Structure of the exam</b>:
			  <ul>
			<li>The problems for the  final exams will be published on the <b>Canvas page</b> of this course and will become available at scheduled times.</li>
			<li>The solutions to the final exam should be written separately and submitted through <b>Gradescope</b> before the submission deadline.</li>
			<li>The written part will be followed by a <b>Zoom</b> conversation with instructors. Have your <b>camera</b> and <b>student ID</b> ready for the oral part.</li></ul></li>
			<li><b>Written part</b>:
			  <ul>
			    <li>The problems for the  final exams will be published on the <b>Canvas page</b> of this course and will become available at scheduled times.</li>
			    <li>You will have <b>90 minutes</b> from the release of the exam on Canvas to write the exam + <b>10 minutes</b> to submit the problems on Gradescope. <b>Do not</b> submit the quiz on Canvas before you submit your exam on Gradescope (I am not sure if all devices allow accessing the quiz questions after submission, so if you submit the quiz too quickly you might lose access to the problems. Alternatively, take a picture of your exam problems at the beginning of the exam.)</li>
		    	    <li>Each student will get a random selection of problems of equal difficulty and covering similar topics.</li>
			    <li>Students taking exams at different times will have their problems selected from different subsets of problems; there is no advantage in taking the exam at later time slots.</li>
			    <li>You have to write your solutions on paper/tablet and submit them through <b>Gradescope</b>. Your answers in Canvas <b>will not</b> be graded.</li>
			    <li>This is an open-book exam. You are allowed to use the textbook, lecture notes, your personal notes. You are not allowed to use the outside assistance. Outside assistance includes but is not limited to other people, the internet and unauthorized notes.</li>
			    <li>You are not allowed to use the calculator or analogous software. All intermediate steps of your computations (computing integrals, solving systems of linear equations etc) should be included in you solutions.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li><b>Oral part</b>:
			  <ul>
			    <li>You will receive the access codes for the Zoom meeting via email one day before the exam.</li>			    <li>The Zoom meeting will start 60 minutes after the beginning of the exam.</li>
			    <li>You have to join the meeting <b>not later than 110 minutes</b> after the beginning of the exam (<b>not later than 20 minutes</b> after the end of the written part). After this deadline the zoom meeting will be locked.</li>
			    <li>After joining the meeting, you will be placed into the waiting room. You will be then added to the conversation room one by one in the order of the submission of your exams on Gradescope for a discussion with the instructors. It is important that you are ready to start the conversation at any time while in the waiting room.</li>
			    <li>After being added to the conversation with the instructors, you have to turn on your camera and show your student ID.</li>
			    <li>The goal of the oral part is to make sure that the students do not use outside help during the unproctored exams. You will be asked questions about your solutions to the written part of the exam submitted on Gradescope. Most of the conversations will be very short. In case of serious inconsistencies between your written and oral answers some additional questions can be asked. If it will become clear that the written part is written using the outside help, the case will be reported to AI. If you write your exam honestly, the oral part is a simple formality.</li>
			    <li>The oral part will not be graded.</li>
			    <li>The oral part will not be recorded.</li>
			</ul></li>
