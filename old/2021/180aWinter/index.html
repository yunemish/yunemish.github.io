	Posts about homework or exams on Piazza should be content based.  While you are encouraged to crowdsource and discuss coursework through
	Piazza, please do not post complete solutions to homework problems there.  Questions about grades should be brought to the instructors,
	in office hours.  You can also post private messages to instructors on Piazza, which we prefer to email. 
	</p> -->
	<br>
	<p>Please, check the following calendar for possible reschedulings of the office hours. You are welcome to attend the office hours of either of the TAs, not just your own.</p>

			 <br>             
             <p>Welcome to Math 180A: a one quarter course introduction to probability theory.  This course is the prerequisite
             for the subsequent courses Math 180B/C (Introduction to Stochastic Processes) and Math 181A/B (Introduction to Mathematical
             Statistics), as well as for MATH 114 (Introduction to Computational Stochastics), MATH 194 (The Mathematics of Finance) and Math 189 (Exploratory Data Analysis and Inference). According to the UC San Diego
             <span href="http://ucsd.edu/catalog/courses/MATH.html" target="_blank">Course Catalog</span>, the topics covered are probability spaces, random variables,
             independence, conditional probability, discrete and continuous probability distributions, joint distributions, variance and moments,
             the Laws of Large Numbers, and the Central Limit Theorem.</p>
             
             <p>Here is a more detailed listing of course topics, in the sequence they will be covered, together with the relevant section(s) of the
               textboox.  While each topic corresponds to approximately one lecture, there will be some give and take here.
	       This is a rough schedule that will be updated during the term.

<p><b>Homework:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Homework assignments are posted <span href="#homework">below</span>, and will be due at <b>11:59pm </b>
  on the indicated due date.&nbsp;  You must turn in your homework through Gradescope; if you have produced it on paper,
  you can scan it or simply take clear photos of it to upload.  Your lowest homework score will be dropped.</b>&nbsp;  It is allowed and even
encouraged to discuss homework problems with your classmates and your instructor and TA, but your final write up of your
homework solutions must be your own work.

  <b><span  name="quizzes">Quizzes</span>:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The quizzes will take place on the dates listed <span href="#dates">above</span>.
  <ul>
    <li>You will able to access the quiz on the course Canvas page starting at 12am (PST) on the day of the quiz. The quiz will be accessible for 24 hours; however, once you start the quiz, you will only have 30 minutes to complete it (unless you start it later than 11:30pm (PST), in which case the 24 hour deadline is enforced since it comes before the end of your 30 minutes). For example, if you start the exam at 11:40pm (PST), you will need to submit it within 20 minutes to receive credit since the 24 hour deadline would come before the end of your 30 minutes.</li>
    <li><b>There will be no makeup quizzes. See <span href="#policies">below</span> for other policies.</b>
      </li>
    </ul>
</p>

			
<p><b><span name="midterms">Midterm Exams</span>:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The midterm exams will take place on January 27 and February 24 as listed <span href="#dates">above</span>.
  <ul>
    <li>The exam will be available for 24 hours on Gradescope starting at 12am (PST) on the scheduled date: however, once you start the exam, you will have 65 minutes to finish and submit your exam. The exam is intended to take 50 minutes: the remaining 15 minutes are intended for the scanning and submission of the exam on Gradescope. In particular, we will not accept submissions after the 65 minute deadline: it is your responsibility to submit the exam on time. For example, if you choose to write the exam for 65 minutes and do not leave yourself enough time to scan the exam, then you will not receive credit for the exam.</li>
    <li>As with the quizzes, the 24 hour deadline supersedes your allotted 65 minutes for the exam. For example, if you start the exam at 11:40pm (PST), you will need to submit it within 20 minutes to receive credit since the 24 hour deadline would come before the end of your 65 minutes.</li>
    <li><b>There will be no makeup midterm exams. See <span href="#policies">below</span> for other policies.</b></li>
    </ul>
</p>


<p>
  <b><span name="finals">Final Exam</span>:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The final examination will be held at the <b>officially scheduled time: 7pm - 10pm (PST) on March 15</b>.
  There may be an additional final examination time slot scheduled for students experiencing extreme time differences.
  <ul>
    <li>It is your responsibility to ensure that you do not have a schedule conflict involving the final examination; you should not enroll in this class if you cannot take the final examination at its scheduled time.</li>
    <li>The written portion of the exam will be available on Gradescope at 7pm (PST) on March 15. Submissions are due at 8:30pm (PST) on Gradescope.</li>
    <li>After the written portion, students will join a Zoom room from 8:30pm - 10pm (PST). During this time, the instructional staff will randomly select students for a follow-up oral exam to ensure academic integrity. A determination will be made based on the oral exam whether or not to file a case with the Office of Academic Integrity. If a student fails to report to the Zoom room, then they will automatically receive no points for the final exam.</li>
    <li><b>There will be no makeup final exam. See <span href="#policies">below</span> for other policies.</b> </li>
    <li>Zoom links and more detailed instructions will be announced later.</li>
  </ul> 
</p>

<p><b><span name="policies">Exam policies</span></b>
  <ul>
    <li>Quizzes and exams are <b>open textbook</b>, and you can rewatch lectures and review the lecture slides.</li>
    <li>Keep in mind that any computations on exams must be supported by clear explanations. Simply writing down an answer without any justification or work will receive 0 points, even if the answer is correct (unless the problem specifically says that no justification is required).</li>
    <li>You are <b>not</b> allowed to use calculators, computer algebra systems, or similar software. Of course, this also means that you will not be asked to solve problems on exams that require the aid of an electronic computing device.</li>
    <li>You are not allowed to consult other people or resources on the internet. In particular, contract cheating and other instances of academic dishonesty can result in suspension or dismissal. According to the <span href="https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/">Academic Integrity Office</span>,
      <br><br>

      <center><cite>About 15% of students reported for cheating are suspended or dismissed from UCSD.</cite></center></li>

<p>
<b>Regrade Policy:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Your exams and homeworks will be graded using <span href="https://gradescope.com/" target="_blank">Gradescope</span>.
 &nbsp;You will be able to request regrades <b><i>directly from your TA</i></b> through Gradescope for a specified window of time.
  &nbsp;Be sure to make your request within the specified window of time; no regrade requests will be accepted after the
   deadline. <b>Note:</b> Your grader will consider your regrade request only if you
			have explained clearly, thoroughly, and politely why you think an error in grading was made.</li>
</li></ul>
</p>


<p><b>Grading:</b> 

  Your cumulative average will be computed as the best of the following weighted averages:
  <ul>
    <li>20% Homework, &nbsp;15% Quizzes, &nbsp;15% Midterm #1, &nbsp;15% Midterm #2, &nbsp;35% Final Exam</li>
    <li>20% Homework, &nbsp;15% Quizzes, &nbsp;15% Best midterm, &nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;50% Final Exam</li>
  </ul>
  
</p>



<p>Your course grade will be determined by your cumulative average at the end of the quarter,
and will be based on the following scale:

<center>        
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="tableBody"><b>A+</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>A</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>A-</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>B+</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>B</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>B-</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>C+</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>C</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>C-</b></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tableBody"><b>97</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>93</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>90</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>87</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>83</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>80</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>77</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>73</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>70</b></td>

</tr>
</tbody>       
</table>
</center>

<p>The above scale is guaranteed: for example, if your cumulative average is 80, your final grade will be <i>at least</i> B-. However,
your instructor may adjust the above scale to be more generous.</p>


			

			
			<p><b>Academic Integrity:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;UC San Diego's
			<span href="http://students.ucsd.edu/academics/academic-integrity/index.html" target="_blank">code of academic integrity</span>
			outlines the expected academic honesty of all studentd and faculty, and details the consequences for academic dishonesty.
			The main issues are cheating and plagiarism, of course, for which we have a zero-tolerance policy.  (Penalties for these
			offenses always include assignment of a failing grade in the course, and usually involve an administrative penalty, such
			as suspension or expulsion, as well.)  However, academic integrity also includes things like giving credit where credit
			is due (listing your collaborators on homework assignments, noting books or papers containing information you used in
			solutions, etc.), and treating your peers respectfully in class. In addition, here are a few of our expectations for
			etiquette in and out of class.</p>

			<ul>
<!--			<li><b>Entering/exiting class:</b> Please arrive on time and stay for the entire class/section period. If, despite your best
			efforts, you arrive late, please enter quietly through the rear door and take a seat near where you entered. Similarly, in the
			rare event that you must leave early (e.g. for a medical appointment), please sit close to the rear exit and leave as
			unobtrusively as possible.</li> -->
<li><b>Noise and common courtesy:</b> When class/section begins, please stop your conversations.
  <!-- Wait until class/section is over before putting your materials away in your backpack, standing up, or talking to friends. -->
  Do not disturb others by engaging in disruptive behavior. Disruption interferes with the learning environment and impairs the ability of others to focus,
			participate, and engage.</li>
<li><b>Electronic devices:</b> <!-- Please do not use devices (such as cell phones, laptops, tablets, iPods) for non-class-related matters while in class/section. -->
  No visual or audio recording of the class meetings is allowed without prior permission of the
			instructor (whether by camera, cell phone, or other means).</li>
			<li><b>E-mail etiquette:</b> You are expected to write as you would in any professional correspondence. E-mail communication
			should be courteous and respectful in manner and tone. Please do not send e-mails that are curt or demanding.</li>
			</ul>

            <p><h4>Accommodations:</h4>

	      Students requesting accommodations for this course due to a disability must provide a current Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter issued by the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD) which is located in University Center 202 behind Center Hall. The AFA letter may be issued by the OSD electronically or in hard-copy; in either case, please make arrangements to discuss your accommodations with me in advance (<b>by the end of Week 2</b>, if possible). We will make every effort to arrange for whatever accommodations are stipulated by the OSD.
