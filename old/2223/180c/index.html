	     <br>

	                  <p>Welcome to Math 180C: a one quarter course introduction to stochastic processes (II).
	       According to the UC San Diego
             <a href="http://ucsd.edu/catalog/courses/MATH.html" target="_blank">Course Catalog</a>, the topics covered are Markov chains in discrete and continuous time, random walk, recurrent events and other topics.</p>
             
             <p>Here is a more detailed listing of course topics, in the sequence they will be covered, together with the relevant section(s) of the
               textbook.  While each topic corresponds to approximately one lecture, there will be some give and take here.
	       This is a rough schedule that will be updated during the term.

			<p>
			<b>Final Exam:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The final examination will be held at the date and time stated <a href="#meetings">above</a>.
			<ul>
			<li>It is your responsibility to ensure that you do not have a schedule conflict involving the final examination; you should not enroll in this class

			<li><i><b>There will be no makeup

<p><b>The above exam policies will be applied to in-person exams. The exam policies will be changed in case of the changes in exam modality. More detailed instructions will be posted on this website later.</b></p>

<p>
<b>Administrative Links:</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; Here are two links regarding UC San Diego policies on exams:
<ul>
<p>
<li><a href="http://blink.ucsd.edu/instructors/academic-info/exams/responsibilities.html" target="_blank">
Exam Responsibilities</a>&nbsp; An outline of the responsibilities of faculty and students
with regard to final exams</li>

Policies on Examinations</a>&nbsp; The Academic Senate policy regarding final examinations
(These are the rules!)</li>
</p>
</ul>
</p>


<p>
<b>Regrade Policy:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Your exams and homeworks will be graded using <a href="https://gradescope.com/" target="_blank">Gradescope</a>.
 &nbsp;You will be able to request regrades <b><i>directly from your TA</i></b> through Gradescope for a specified window of time.
  &nbsp;Be sure to make your request within the specified window of time; no regrade requests will be accepted after the
   deadline. <b>Note:</b> Your grader will consider your regrade request only if you
			have explained clearly, thoroughly, and politely why you think an error in grading was made.</li>
</li></ul>
</p>


<p><b>Grading:</b> 

  Your cumulative average will be computed as the best of the following weighted averages:
  <ul>
    <li>20% Homework, &nbsp;20% Midterm 1, &nbsp;20% Midterm 2, &nbsp;40% Final Exam</li>
    <li>20% Homework, &nbsp;20% Best midterm, &nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;60% Final Exam</li>
  </ul>
  
</p>



<p>Your course grade will be determined by your cumulative average at the end of the quarter,
and will be based on the following scale:

<center>        
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="tableBody"><b>A+</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>A</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>A-</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>B+</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>B</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>B-</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>C+</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>C</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>C-</b></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tableBody"><b>97</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>93</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>90</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>87</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>83</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>80</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>77</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>73</b></td>
<td class="tableBody"><b>70</b></td>

</tr>
</tbody>       
</table>
</center>

<p>The above scale is guaranteed: for example, if your cumulative average is 80, your final grade will be <i>at least</i> B-. However,
your instructor may adjust the above scale to be more generous.</p>


			

			
			<p><b>Academic Integrity:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;UC San Diego
			<a href="http://students.ucsd.edu/academics/academic-integrity/index.html" target="_blank">code of academic integrity</a>
			outlines the expected academic honesty of all studentd and faculty, and details the consequences for academic dishonesty.
			The main issues are cheating and plagiarism, of course, for which we have a zero-tolerance policy.  (Penalties for these
			offenses always include assignment of a failing grade in the course, and usually involve an administrative penalty, such
			as suspension or expulsion, as well.)  However, academic integrity also includes things like giving credit where credit
			is due (listing your collaborators on homework assignments, noting books or papers containing information you used in
			solutions, etc.), and treating your peers respectfully in class. In addition, here are a few of our expectations for
			etiquette in and out of class.</p>

			<ul>
<!--			<li><b>Entering/exiting class:</b> Please arrive on time and stay for the entire class/section period. If, despite your best
			efforts, you arrive late, please enter quietly through the rear door and take a seat near where you entered. Similarly, in the
			rare event that you must leave early (e.g. for a medical appointment), please sit close to the rear exit and leave as
			unobtrusively as possible.</li> -->
<li><b>Noise and common courtesy:</b> When class/section begins, please stop your conversations.
  <!-- Wait until class/section is over before putting your materials away in your backpack, standing up, or talking to friends. -->
  Do not disturb others by engaging in disruptive behavior. Disruption interferes with the learning environment and impairs the ability of others to focus,
			participate, and engage.</li>
<li><b>Electronic devices:</b> <!-- Please do not use devices (such as cell phones, laptops, tablets, iPods) for non-class-related matters while in class/section. -->
  No visual or audio recording of the class meetings is allowed without prior permission of the
			instructor (whether by camera, cell phone, or other means).</li>
			<li><b>E-mail etiquette:</b> You are expected to write as you would in any professional correspondence. E-mail communication
			should be courteous and respectful in manner and tone. Please do not send e-mails that are curt or demanding.</li>
			</ul>
