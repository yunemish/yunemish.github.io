    <div class="content">
      <br> Abstract: The stochastic block model has been one of the most fruitful research topics in community detection and clustering. Recently, community detection on hypergraphs have become an important topic in higher-order network analysis. We consider the  detection problem in a sparse random tensor model called the hypergraph stochastic block model (HSBM). We prove that a spectral method based on the non-backtracking operator for hypergraphs works with high probability down to the generalized Kesten-Stigum detection threshold conjectured by Angelini et al. We characterize the spectrum of the non-backtracking operator for the sparse random hypergraph, and provide an efficient dimension reduction procedure using the Ihara-Bass formula for hypergraphs. As a result, the community detection problem can be reduced to an eigenvector problem of a non-normal matrix constructed from the adjacency matrix and the degree matrix of the hypergraph.

    <div class="content">
    <br> Abstract: The limiting eigenvalue distributions of two well-known random matrix ensemble, the GUE and the Ginibre ensemble, are respectively the semicircle law (the density is semicircular in the interval \([-2,2]\)) and the circular law (the uniform measure on the disk of radius \(1\)). These two distributions have a simple relation: the push-forward of the circular law by \(z\to 2\operatorname{Re}(z)\) is the semicircular law. Recent results in random matrix theory show that this simple relation can be generalized into other Gaussian random matrix models; however, these results work with the (continuous) limiting eigenvalue distributions. In this talk, I will present a recent conjecture with Brian Hall. At the finite-\(N\) level, the push-forward property can be accomplished by applying the heat operator to the random characteristic polynomial of a random matrix model. For example, if we apply the heat operator at time \(1/N\) to the characteristic polynomial of the GUE, the roots of the resulting polynomial resemble the circular law.

    <div class="content">
    <br> Abstract: We prove that the eigenvectors of Wigner matrices satisfy the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis (ETH), which is a strong form of Quantum Unique Ergodicity (QUE) with an optimal speed of convergence. Then, using this a priori bound as an input, we analyze the Stochastic Eigenstate Equation (SEE) and prove Gaussian fluctuations in QUE.
The main methods behind the above results are: (i) multi-resolvents local laws established via a novel bootstrap scheme; (ii) energy estimates for SEE.

    <br> Abstract: We consider the density of states of structured Hermitian random matrices with a variance profile. As the dimension tends to infinity the associated eigenvalue density can develop a singularity at the origin. The severity of this singularity depends on the relative positions of the zero submatrices. We provide a classification of all possible singularities and determine the exponent in the density blow-up.

    <div class="content">
      <br> Abstract: This talk aims to report on the fluctuations of traces of powers of a random \(n\) by \(n\) matrix \(U\) distributed according to the Haar measure on the unitary group. This classical random matrix problem has been extensively studied using several different methods such as asymptotics of Toeplitz determinants, representation theory, loop equations etc. It turns out that for any \(kâ‰¥1\), \(\mathrm{Tr} [U^k]\) converges as \(n\) tends to infinity to a Gaussian random variable with a super exponential rate of convergence. In this talk, I will explain some of these results and present some recent work with Kurt Johansson (KTH) in which we revisited this problem in a multivariate setting.

    <div class="content">
    <br> Abstract: Extremal eigenvalues of graphs are of particular interest in theoretical computer science and combinatorics. In particular, the spectral gap, the gap between the first and second largest eigenvalues, measures the expanding property of the graph. In this talk, I will focus on random \(d\)-regular graphs. I'll first explain some conjectures on the extremal eigenvalue distributions of adjacency matrices of random \(d\)-regular graphs; some have been solved, some are still widely open. In the second part of the talk, I will give a new proof of Alon's second eigenvalue conjecture that with high probability, the second eigenvalue of a random \(d\)-regular graph is bounded by \(2\sqrt{d-1}+o(1)\), where we can show that the error term is polynomially small in the size of the graph. This is based on a joint work with Horng-Tzer Yau.

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Title: The model deformation phenomenon in random matrix theory</button>
    <div class="content">
    <br> Abstract: The two most basic results in random matrix theory are the semicircular law for Hermitian random matrices (eigenvalues with a semicircular distribution on \([-2,2]\) ) and the circular law for non-Hermitian matrices (eigenvalues uniformly distributed over the unit disk). We can relate these results as follows: twice the real part of the eigenvalues in the circular law has the same bulk distribution as the eigenvalues in the semicircular law. This observation is at one level trivial: if \(z\) is uniformly distributed over the unit disk in the plane, then \(2\operatorname{Re}(z)\) has a semicircular distribution on \([-2,2]\). But at another level, it is mysterious: why should the real part of the eigenvalues in one random matrix model be related to the eigenvalues in another random matrix model?

     I will argue that this result is part of a general phenomenon in which we can build pairs of random matrix models for which the bulk eigenvalue distributions are related in a similar way. Specifically, we will try to construct a pair \(Z_1\) and \(Z_2\) of random matrices along with a map \(\Phi\) of the plane to itself such that pushing forward the limiting eigenvalue distribution of \(Z_1\) under \(\Phi\) gives the limiting eigenvalue distribution of \(Z_2\). The talk will be self-contained and will include lots of pictures. This is joint work with Ching Wei Ho and is based in part on earlier joint work with Bruce Driver and Todd Kemp.

    <div class="content">
    <br> Abstract: The perceptron is a toy model of a single-layer neural network that "stores" a collection of given patterns. We consider the model on the \(N\)-dimensional discrete cube with \(M=N \alpha\) patterns, with a general activation function \(U\) that is bounded above. For \(U\) bounded away from zero, or \(U\) a one-sided threshold function, it was shown by Talagrand (2000, 2011) that for small \(\alpha\), the free energy of the model converges in the large-\(N\) limit to the replica symmetric formula conjectured in the physics literature (Krauth and Mezard, 1989). We give a new proof of this result, which covers the more general class of all functions \(U\) that are bounded above and satisfy a certain variance bound.

    <div class="content">
    <br> Abstract: The eigenvalue distributions of random matrix ensembles often admit a generalization involving the "inverse temperature" parameter \(\beta > 0\). We focus on two examples: the Hermite ensemble (eigenvalue distribution of GUE) and the spectra of sums of Hermitian random matrices. For both examples, we prove a Law of Large Numbers in the high temperature regime: the size of the system tends to infinity, while the inverse temperature \(\beta\) tends to zero. In our second example, we discover a new binary operation between probability measures, which interpolates between convolution and free additive convolution.

    <div class="content">
      <br> Abstract: We establish a quantitative criterion for an operator defined on a Galton-Watson random tree for having an absolutely continuous spectrum. For the adjacency operator, this criterion requires that the offspring distribution has a relative variance below a threshold.
      
      As a by-product, we prove that the adjacency operator of a supercritical Poisson Galton-Watson tree has a non-trivial absolutely continuous part if the average degree is large enough. We also prove that its Karp and Sipser core has purely absolutely spectrum on an interval if the average degree is large enough. We finally illustrate our criterion on the Anderson model on a regular infinite tree and give a quantitative version of Klein's Theorem on the existence of an absolutely continuous part.
      
      These results find applications on the delocalization of eigenvectors of sparse random graphs.

    <div class="content">
      <br> Abstract: A graph \(G\) is said to \(H\)&#8211;percolate if, by iteratively completing copies of \(H\) minus an edge, all missing edges are eventually added. This process was introduced in early work of Bollob&aacute;s (1967), and studied more recently by Balogh, Bollob&aacute;s and Morris (2012) in the case that \(G\) is the Erd&#337;s&#8211;R&eacute;nyi random graph \(G(n,p)\). In this talk, we will discuss our recent joint work with Zsolt Bartha (TU Eindhoven), which locates the critical threshold \(p_c\) (at which point \(G(n,p)\) is likely to \(H\)&#8211;percolate) for all &quot;reasonably balanced&quot graphs \(H\). When \(H\) is the complete graph \(K_r\), this answers an open problem of Balogh, Bollob&aacute;s and Morris.

    <div class="content">
    <br> Abstract: We study an inhomogeneous sparse random graph, \(G_N\), on \([N] = \{1,\dots,N\}\) as introduced in a seminal paper [BJR07] by Bollob&aacute;s, Janson and Riordan (2007): vertices have a type (here in a compact metric space), and edges between different vertices occur randomly and independently over all vertex pairs, with a probability depending on the two vertex types. In the limit of large \(N\), we consider the sparse regime, where the average degree is \(O(1)\). We prove a large-deviations principle with explicit rate function for the statistics of the collection of all the connected components, registered according to their vertex type sets, and distinguished according to being microscopic (of finite size) or macroscopic (of size \(\asymp  N\)). In doing so, we
derive explicit logarithmic asymptotics for the probability that \(G_N\) is connected. We present a full analysis of the rate function including its minimizers. From this analysis we deduce a number of limit laws, conditional and unconditional, which provide comprehensive information about all the microscopic and macroscopic components of \(G_N\). In particular, we recover the criterion for the existence of the phase transition of the emergence of a giant cluster given in [BJR07].

    <div class="content">
    <br> Abstract: Gibbs measures are ubiquitous in statistical mechanics and probability theory. In this talk I will discuss two types of classes of Gibbs measures - random line ensembles and triangular particle arrays, which have received considerable attention due, in part, to their occurrence in integrable probability. 
Gibbsian line ensembles can be thought of as collections of finite or countably infinite independent random walkers whose distribution is reweighed by the sum of local interactions between the walkers. I will discuss some recent progress in the asymptotic study of Gibbsian line ensembles, summarizing some joint works with Barraquand, Corwin, Matetski, Wu and others.
Beta-corners processes are Gibbs measures on triangular arrays of interacting particles and can be thought of as analogues/extensions of multi-level spectral measures of random matrices. I will discuss some recent progress on establishing the global asymptotic behavior of beta-corners processes, summarizing some joint works with Das and Knizel.

    <div class="content">
    <br> Abstract: In a seminal paper, Chatterjee and Varadhan derived an LDP for the dense Erd&odblac;s-R&eacute;nyi random graph, viewed as a random graphon. This directly provides LDPs for continuous functionals such as subgraph counts, spectral norms, etc. In contrast, very little is understood about this problem if the underlying random graph is <i>inhomogeneous</i> or <i>constrained</i>.<br>

    In this talk, we will explore large deviations for dense random graphs, beyond the <q>mean-field</q> setting.  In particular, we will study large deviations for uniform random graphs with given degrees, and a family of dense block model random graphs. We will establish the LDP in each case, and identify the rate function. In the block model setting, we will use this LDP to study the upper tail problem for homomorphism densities of regular sub-graphs. Our results establish that this problem exhibits a symmetry/symmetry-breaking transition, similar to one observed for Erd&odblac;s-R&eacute;nyi random graphs.<br>

    <div class="content">
    <br> Abstract: L&eacute;vy matrices are symmetric matrices whose entries are random variables with infinite variance; they are governed by a parameter \(\alpha \in (0, 2)\) dictating the power law decay of their entries. For \(\alpha < 1\), they are believed to serve as one of the few examples of a matrix model exhibiting a mobility edge, also called an Anderson transition, that separates chaotic (GOE) eigenvalue spacing statistics from ordered (Poisson) ones. In this talk we describe results concerning the statistics for the eigenvalue spacings and eigenvector entries of L&eacute;vy matrices. In particular, for \(\alpha \in (1, 2)\) their eigenvalue statistics asymptotically follow those of the GOE throughout the spectrum, and for \(\alpha < 1\) the same statement holds around small eigenvalues.

    the system dynamics on an LLN-type scale. If time permits, we apply our results to elucidate the key determinants of protein synthesis, which motivated the introduction of TASEP fifty years ago.

    result, we reframe the counting problem as an optimization problem, and find the probability distribution on the set of all integer partitions with maximum entropy among those that satisfy our
    restrictions in expectation (in essence, this is an application of Jaynes' principle of maximum entropy). This approach leads to an approximate version of our formula as the solution to a relatively
    straightforward optimization problem over real-valued functions. To establish more precise asymptotics, we prove a local central limit theorem using an equidistribution result of Green and Tao.<br>
    A large portion of the talk will be devoted to outlining how our method can be used to re-derive a classical result of Hardy and Ramanujan, with an emphasis on the intuitions behind the method, and
    limited technical detail. This is joint work with Marcus Michelen and Will Perkins.

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Title: Stochastic quantization and Yang-Mills</button>
    <div class="content">
    <br> Abstract: We briefly overview the current developments of rigorous constructions in <q>stochastic quantization</q> - an active field linking quantum field theory with stochastic PDE. We then focus on stochastic quantization of the Yang-Mills model in 2 and 3 space dimensions. This includes constructing the Langevin dynamic for the formal Yang-Mills measure, defining the state space of gauge orbits, proving gauge equivariance of the dynamic, and making sense of Wilson loop observables in this context. We will also discuss some future directions.
      <br>The talk is based on several works mostly joint with A.Chandra, I.Chevyrev, and M.Hairer.

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Title: Spectral stability under random perturbations</button>
    <div class="content">
    <br> Consider an \(n\times n\) deterministic matrix \(A\) and a random matrix \(M\) with independent standard Gaussian entries. In this talk I will discuss recent results that state that, if \(||A||\leq 1\), for any \(\delta>0\), with high probability \(A+\delta M\) has eigenvector condition number of order poly\((n/\delta)\) and eigenvalue gaps of order poly\((\delta/n)\), which implies that the randomly perturbed matrix has a stable spectrum. This has useful applications to numerical analysis and was used to obtain the fastest known provable algorithm for diagonalizing an arbitrary matrix.<br>
       This is joint work with Jess Banks, Archit Kulkarni and Nikhil Srivastava.<br> <br>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Title: Overlaps between eigenvectors of non-Hermitian random matrices</button>
    <div class="content">
    <br> Abstract: Right and left eigenvectors of non-Hermitian matrices form a bi-orthogonal system to which one can associate homogeneous quantities known as overlaps.
    The matrix of overlaps quantifies the stability of the spectrum and characterizes the joint eigenvalues increments under Dyson-type dynamics.
    Overlaps first appeared in the physics literature: Chalker and Mehlig calculated their conditional expectation for complex Ginibre matrices (1998).
    For the same model, we extend their results by deriving the distribution of the overlaps and their correlations (joint work with P. Bourgade).
    Similar results have been obtained in other integrable settings, namely quaternionic Gaussian matrices,
    as well as matrices from the spherical and truncated unitary ensembles.

    <div class="content">
    <br> Abstract: The 2-spin spherical Sherrington Kirkpatrick (SSK) model was introduced by Kosterlitz, Thouless and Jones as a simplification of the usual Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with Ising spins. The SSK model admits tractable formulas for many of its observables, allowing for a detailed analysis of its fluctuations using techniques from random matrix theory. We discuss recent results on the fluctuations of the SSK model with a magnetic field as well as at critical temperature. Based on joint work with P. Sosoe.

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Title: Scaling Limits for Shortest Remaining Processing Time Queues</button>
    <div class="content">
    <br> Abstract: In an SRPT queue, the job with the shortest remaining processing time is served first, with preemption.  The SRPT scheduling rule is of interest due to its optimality properties; it minimizes queue length (number of jobs in system).  However, even with Markovian distributional assumptions on the processing times, an exact analysis is not possible.  Hence, approximations in the form of a fluid (functional law of large numbers) limit or a diffusion (functional central limit theorem) limit can provide insights into system performance.  It was shown by Gromoll, Kruk and Puha (2011) that, if the processing time distribution has unbounded support, then, under standard heavy traffic conditions, the diffusion limit of the queue length process is identically equal to zero.  This exhibits the queue length minimization property of SRPT in sharpest relief.  It also demonstrates that the SRPT queue length process is orders of magnitude smaller than the workload process in the diffusion limit.  (The workload process tracks the time it will take the server to process the work associated with each job in system.) In this talk, we report on progress in characterizing this order of magnitude difference.  We find that distribution dependent scaling must be used to obtain a nontrivial limit for the queue length and the associated measure valued state descriptor.  The scaling captures the order of magnitude difference, and the nature of the limit is dependent on the tail decay of the processing time distribution.
